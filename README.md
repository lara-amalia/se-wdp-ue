# WDP3 Exercises – HTML & CSS Basics

In three exercises we will build a small portfolio website, consisting of a homepage and some subpages.

The most important subpage of the website will be the description and documentation of your semester project.

The website has to be submitted together with your semester project one week before the final presentations via eLearning.

## Tools you will need

A **text editor** of your choice, e.g. Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, WebStorm,…

A **browser** of your choice, e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari,…

## What you can find in this repo

In this repository you can find all exercise descriptions, templates you can start with, snippets that may be useful during development, and also my personal solution for all exercises.

To benefit most from the exercises try to find solutions for problems on your own, using slides from the lecture and/or online documentation and by helping each other. If you're really stuck, take a look at the exercise solutions in this repository. And always feel free to reach out to me and ask for help!
